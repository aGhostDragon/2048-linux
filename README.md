# 2048 Linux
A Linux-themed fork of Gabriele Cirulli's [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), which is a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

The distros I chose to use in this game were the first few distros I could think of. The order is completely arbitrary.

 You can play it at http://mm2718.github.io/2048-linux/
